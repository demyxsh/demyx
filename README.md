* Development mode includes the tools code-server, BrowserSync, and Demyx BrowserSync plugin
* Auto scale containers with callback (see the custom folder)
* Custom healthchecks
* WP-CLI

### Demyx Image
Since the image needs docker.sock to be mounted and the Docker binary is included, I've installed sudo to only allow the demyx user to execute only one script as root. The image is put in production mode by default, meaning that /demyx directory and all it's folders and files will be set to read-only mode. This prevents the non-privelege user to modify the script and do malicious things.

* user/group: demyx:demyx (1000:1000)
* docker (binary)
* bash
* curl
* git
* gnupg
* jq
* nano
* oh-my-zsh
* s6-overlay
* sudo
* tzdata
* util-linux
* zsh

### Privacy
I have a tracker that is enabled by default. It sends a curl request to demyx.sh server daily at midnight PST. No data is collected except your server's IP address, which is logged to the web server like any other visitor on a browser. I have this enabled so I can track how many active installs there are of Demyx. The curl request uses a token (generated by OpenSSL with a passphrase) to prevent abuse and duplicate entries. What I intend to do with this data is just show a graph of active Demyx installs, just like WordPress plugin stats. 

If you are uncomfortable with this, then you can turn off the tracker by running the command below OR keep it turned on to show your support! [COMMIT CHANGES](https://github.com/demyxco/demyx/commit/7deb9bb93bf598c07f0a13107548d397624e7638)
```
# Execute in the host OS
demyx exec stack --tracker=false

# Execute in the demyx container
demyx stack --tracker=false
```

### Requirements
* Docker
* Bash
* Dedicated/KVM server with Linux
* Port 80 and 443 must be open
* Primary domain must be pointed to server's IP and must have a wildcard CNAME subdomain

### Install
```
wget demyx.sh/install && sudo bash install
```

### Getting Started
```
# Create a WordPress site on the host OS
demyx exec run domain.tld --cdn --cache

# Create a WordPress site in the demyx container
demyx run domain.tld --cdn --cache
```

### chroot.sh
This script helps you change root to the demyx container, it's installed on the host OS and lives in /usr/local/bin. Executing the install script will automatically install the Demyx chroot script. The chroot script will start the demyx container, bind ports 2222 for SSH, and 2022 for Eternal Terminal by default. These ports can be overriden by the script.
```
docker run -dit \
    --name demyx \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --hostname "$DEMYX_CHROOT_HOST" \
    --network demyx \
